*lab3 involve two makefile,I use "Makefile" for lab3-A" 
 MakefileB" for lab3-B and also upload executable file 
 of lab3-A(mainA) lab3-B(mainB).
*So please use ./executable file to check my program and 
 not need to compile(make again).

A.use Makefile to compile,and the programe can show the weight of top 5 cows.


B.      n                100       1000       10000         100000

       sort          0.000882    0.00786     0.06303        0.388432
 
insertion sort       0.028022    1.0344      103.568        10319.4

insertion sort/sort    31.8      132.05       1643.8        26595

      n^2/nlogn         50         333         2500         20000


According to the result of the program,we can see the needed time of sort and insertion sort 
approximately match n^2/nlogn,because the process of two sort are different.
